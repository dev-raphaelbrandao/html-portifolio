<h3>Inception (2014)</h3>
<p>
  Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of
  extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during
  the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability
  has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate
  espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him
  everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at
  redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can
  accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and
  his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to
  steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect
  crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for
  the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only
  Cobb could have seen coming.
